# SCT_ML_1
# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts house prices using Multiple Linear Regression based on:
- Square Footage
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms

## 🎯 Objective
To build a regression model that estimates housing prices using numerical features and evaluate its performance.

## 📊 Dataset
Features:
- sqft
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
Target:
- price

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Model
Multiple Linear Regression

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Square footage has the strongest influence on price.
- Bedrooms and bathrooms positively impact price.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add location feature
